## Overview
The challenge was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

### Features
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

### TODOs
* ~~Add skeleton loaders~~
* ~~Include `All` label in select region dropdown + caching previous one~~
* ~~Create light theme~~
* ~~Create details model window about each country~~
* Improve design while `details` window maximized
* ~~Compete search feature~~
* ~~Make app fully adaptive~~
* ~~Add border countries into details window~~
