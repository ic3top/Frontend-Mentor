# Countries wiki
> Here is my [solution](https://ic3top.github.io/Frontend-Mentor/countries-wiki/dist/) to the Countries-wiki challenge.

## Overview
The challenge was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.
It's a first project where I tried using vue test utils, probably I'll add all of my tests soon.

- VUE 3

### Useful resources
- [Rest countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) used in this project.

## Features
